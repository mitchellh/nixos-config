# NixOS System Configurations

This repository contains my NixOS system configurations. This repository
isn't meant to be a turnkey solution to copying my setup or learning Nix,
so I want to apologize to anyone trying to look for something "easy". I've
tried to use very simple Nix practices wherever possible, but if you wish
to copy from this, you'll have to learn the basics of Nix, NixOS, etc.

I don't claim to be an expert at Nix or NixOS, so there are certainly
improvements that could be made! Feel free to suggest them, but please don't
be offended if I don't integrate them, I value having my config work over
having it be optimal.

## How I Work

I like to use macOS as the host OS and NixOS within a VM as my primary
development environment. I use the graphical applications on the host
(browser, calendars, mail app, iMessage, etc.) but I do almost everything
dev-related in the VM (editor, compilation, databases, etc.).

Inevitably I get asked **why?** I genuinely like the macOS application
ecosystem, and I'm pretty "locked in" to their various products such as
iMessage. I like the Apple hardware, and I particularly like that my hardware
always Just Works with excellent performance, battery life, and service.
However, I prefer the Linux environment for almost all my dev work. I find
that modern computers are plenty fast enough for the best of both worlds.

Here is what it ends up looking like:

Note that I usually full screen the VM so there isn't actually a window,
and I three-finger swipe or use other keyboard shortcuts to active that
window.

### Common Questions Related To This Workflow

**How does web application development work?** I use the VM's IP. Even
though it isn't strictly static, it never changes since I rarely run
other VMs. You just have to make sure software in the VM listens
on `0.0.0.0` so that it isn't only binding to loopback.

**Does copy/paste work?** Yes.

**Do you use shared folders?** I set up a shared folder so I can access
the home directory of my host OS user, but I very rarely use it. I primarily
only use it to access browser downloads. You can see this setup in these
Nix files.

**Do you ever launch graphical applications in the VM?** Sometimes, but rarely.
I'll sometimes do OAuth flows and stuff using FireFox in the VM. Most of the
time, I use the host OS browser.

**Do you have graphical performance issues?** Graphical applications can
have framerate issues, particularly animation. I try to avoid doing any of
this in the VM and only do terminal UIs. Terminal workflows have no performance
issues ever.

**This can't actually work! This only works on a powerful workstation!**
I've been doing this for almost  2 years now, and I've developed
[a lot of very real software](https://www.hashicorp.com/). It works for me.
I also use this VM on a MacBook Pro (to be fair, it is maxed out on specs),
and I have no issues whatsoever.

**Does this work with Apple Silicon Macs?** Yes, using the VMware Fusion
Public Preview (at the time of writing). There are some issues, but its
entirely workable. I'll keep improving this since my primary machine will
be an Apple Silicon machine soon.

## Setup

If you need an ISO for NixOS, you can build your own in the `iso` folder.
For x86-64, I usually just download the official ISO, but I build the
ISO from scratch for aarch64. There is a make target `iso/nixos.iso` you can use for
building an ISO. You'll also need a `docker` running on your machine for building an ISO.

```
$ make iso/nixos.iso
```

Create a VMware Fusion VM with the following settings. My configurations
are made for VMware Fusion exclusively currently and you will have issues
on other virtualization solutions without minor changes.

  * ISO: NixOS 21.11 or later.
  * Disk: SATA 150 GB+
  * CPU/Memory: I give at least half my cores and half my RAM, as much as you can.
  * Graphics: Full acceleration, full resolution, maximum graphics RAM.
  * Network: Shared with my Mac.
  * Remove sound card, remove video camera.
  * Profile: Disable almost all keybindings

Boot the VM, and using the graphical console, change the root password to "root":

```
$ sudo su
$ passwd
# change to root
```

Run `ifconfig` and get the IP address of the first device. It is probably
`192.168.58.XXX`, but it can be anything. In a terminal with this repository
set this to the `NIXADDR` env var:

```
$ export NIXADDR=<VM ip address>
```

The Makefile assumes an Intel processor by default. If you are using an
ARM-based processor (M1, etc.), you must change `NIXNAME` so that the ARM-based
configuration is used:

```
$ export NIXNAME=vm-aarch64
```

Perform the bootstrap. This will install NixOS on the VM disk image together
with customizations using this configuration:

```
$ make vm/bootstrap
```

You should have a graphical functioning dev VM.

At this point, I never use Mac terminals ever again. I clone this repository
in my VM and I use the other Make tasks such as `make test`, `make switch`, etc.
to make changes my VM.

## FAQ

### Why do you still use `niv`?

I am still transitioning into a fully flaked setup. During this transition
(which is indefinite, I'm in no rush), I'm using both.
